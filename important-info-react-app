Optional: Instructions for following along locally using your preferred text editor
This setup requires more work but allows you to complete the tutorial using an editor of your choice. Here are the steps to follow:

Make sure you have a recent version of Node.js installed.
Follow the installation instructions for Create React App to make a new project.
```npx create-react-app my-app```
Delete all files in the src/ folder of the new project
Note:

Don’t delete the entire src folder, just the original source files inside it. We’ll replace the default source files with examples for this project in the next step.

cd my-app
cd src

# If you're using a Mac or Linux:
rm -f *

# Or, if you're on Windows:
del *

# Then, switch back to the project folder
cd ..
Add a file named index.css in the src/ folder with this CSS code.

Add a file named index.js in the src/ folder with this JS code.

Add these three lines to the top of index.js in the src/ folder:

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
Now if you run npm start in the project folder and open http://localhost:3000 in the browser, you should see an empty tic-tac-toe field.

We recommend following these instructions to configure syntax highlighting for your editor.
